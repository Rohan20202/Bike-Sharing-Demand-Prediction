# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction


# Problem Statement 

Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.


# Objective

The main objective of the project is to build a model to predict the demand of rental bikes and the bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes. 


# Dataset Peeping

The dataset had 8,760 observations, with each observation representing one hour of one day. The target variable is ‘Rented Bike Count’ and there were 13 attributes to work with. The baseline rental count for any given day is 735 bikes.


# Approach

As the problem statement says, the main objective is to predict demand of rental bikes and the bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes. We use  supervised learning regression analysis Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest Regression for the purpose of training the dataset to predict future supply and demand of bikes.


# Tools Used 
The whole project was done using python, in google collaborator. Following libraries were used for analyzing the data and visualizing: 

● Pandas: Extensively used to load and wrangle with the dataset. 

● Matplotlib: Used for visualization. 

● Seaborn: Used for visualization. 

● Warnings: For filtering and ignoring warnings. 

● Numpy: For some math operations in predictions. 

● Sklearn: For analysis and prediction.

● Stats models: For outliers influence.
